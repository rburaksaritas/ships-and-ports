# ships-and-ports
A simulation of ships and ports. There are ports, and ships are sailing between them. Ships are carrying the following types of containers: basic, heavy, refrigerated, liquid, and each of them should be handled differently. Containers in a port can be loaded toships, and, conversely, they can be unloaded from a ship to port. Ships need a certain amount of fuel to sail from one port to another.
